# utcoffset-gnome-clock

A simple gnome extension that displays the time in a format like `2025-12-18 12:15 -0800 (18:15 UTC)`.

I followed https://gjs.guide/extensions/development/creating.html and took inspiration from how
https://github.com/KEIII/gnome-shell-panel-date-format/blob/master/extension.js works.
